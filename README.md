Python-API-Challenge

This script has been used to visualize the weather of over 500 cities, with various distances from the equator. The code uses Open Weather Map API to get data to create a series of scatter plots which show the following relationships:

Latitude vs Temperature

Latitude vs Humidity

Latitude vs Cloudiness

Latitude vs Wind Speed

It also uses the same information to work out the Linear Regression line for each relationship. It has also been seperated into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
